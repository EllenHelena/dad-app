# dad-app
Hackday Project

My project idea for the Hackday is to create a daddy app. The app can be used by dads that want to participate in parenting but get stuck sometimes. For example, they forget when to feed, how to feed and how much to feed. Because of the limited amount of time that is given the only features that I wish to include for now, are;
-	User should be able to sign up.
-	User should be able to login.
-	User should be able to create a baby profile.
-	User should be able to add bottles in the baby profile which will show in a day schedule, this contains the amount and time that the bottle should be given (example ‘bottle 1, 180cc, at 08:00’).
-	User should be able to click on a checkbox next to the bottle in the schedule when the bottle is given. 
-	User should be able to get instructions on how to do the task. This will be featured in a ‘help’ section, where I’ll create a connection with Youtube by using the external Youtube API to showcase instruction videos on ‘how to bottle feed your baby’.

Future features

The daddy app can contain many features. Think off, add several things to the schedule, such as; change diaper, give a snack, baby naps and set alarms for all these elements. Add baby photo’s and send notifications to a partner account member when the task is done could be included as well.
